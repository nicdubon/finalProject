		<h1> Molloy College</h1>
		<p>This fall I just started at <a href = "https://www.molloy.edu">Molloy College</a>. I absolutely love it here. I'm on the <a href = "sports.html#Rugby">Women's Rugby</a> team and I see my teammates and my friends all the time on campus. It's a huge adjustent from high school but I definitely like college a lot better than I liked high school. When I was looking at schools last years I went to a few local schools but Molloy stood out to me. There is a huge sense of community here. I also liked the small class sizes and the location. There were a lot of factrs that made me realize Molloy was the right choice for me.</p>
