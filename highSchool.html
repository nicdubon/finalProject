		<h1>Wellington C. Mepham</h1>
		<p>I attended Wellington C. Mepham, typically referred to as <a href = "http://www.bellmore-merrick.k12.ny.us/schools/wellington_c_mepham_high_school">"Mepham"</a>, for my four years of high school. While I was there I participated in many events, clubs, and sports <a href = "hs_involvement.html">(Involvement)</a>. I graduated high school in June 2019 <a href = "graduation.html">(Graduation)</a>. Overall I enjoyed my high school years, but I was ready to move onto the next chapter of my life, college.</p>
