    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>
        I was born on July 23, 2001 in Bethpage, New York at what is now St. Joseph's Hospital to Cindy and Neil Dubon. Two and a half years later I was <em>blessed</em> with a little brother named Christopher. 
    </p>
    <h2>Middle Years</h2>
    <p>
        I had a good childhood, I got along with my brother and I had a lot of friends. I always spent my time outside doing things like
      <ul>
        <li>playing soccer</li>
        <li>playing basketball</li>
        <li>riding my bike</li>

    <p>
      I was never really a big fan of school though I always manged to get good grades. The schools I attended throughout my academic career include:
      <ol>
        <li>Joyful Noise Pre School</li>
        <li>Martin Avenue Elementary School</li>
        <li>Grand Avenue Middle School</li>
        <li>Wellington C. Mepham High School</li>
        <li>Molloy College</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Current</h2>
    <p>
        Currently I am 18 years old and a freshman at <a href = "https://www.molloy.edu">Molloy College</a>. 
        <br>"Molloy College, an independent, Catholic college rooted in the Dominican tradition of study, spirituality, service and community, is committed to academic excellence with respect for each person. Through transformative education, Molloy promotes a lifelong search for truth and the development of ethical leadership."</br> 
        At Molloy, I'm on the <a href = "https://molloylions.com/schedule.aspx?path=wrug">women's rugby</a> team and in the honors program. Last year I graduated from <a href = "http://www.bellmore-merrick.k12.ny.us/schools/wellington_c_mepham_high_school">Mepham High School</a>, which is in Bellmore, NY, where I have lived my entire life. So far I really like it here at Molloy and I can't wait for the next four years!
